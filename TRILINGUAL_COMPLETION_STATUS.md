## 🎯 **SYSTEM OVERVIEW**

**How It Works:**
1. **English (Primary)** → Stored in main tables
2. **French/Serbian** → Stored in translation tables
3. **Language Tabs** → Admin forms have 🇺🇸🇫🇷🇷🇸 tabs
4. **Auto Fallback** → Missing translations show English

**Translation Flow:**
```
Admin creates content → Language tabs → English + FR/SR → Database → Public display with language switching
```
